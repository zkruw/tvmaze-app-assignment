## Limitations and improvement suggestions

I spent around 5 hours on the assignment. With a bigger time frame here are some things I would consider:

 - Breadcrumbs, so that it would be easier for the user to navigate back and forth.
 - Work on accessibility so people with screen readers and other assistive tools can use the application.
 - Check for older browsers and display a message.
 - Localization with a library such as react-intl or similar.
 - More unit tests, currently only the basics are covered.
 - Caching of search results.
 - Autocomplete of search results.
 - Server side rendering with Next.js
